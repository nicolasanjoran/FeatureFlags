## [2.5.1] - 2019-12-23
### Changed
Fix for broken SPM build due to lack of specifity in Package.swift exclusion rule.

## [2.5.0] - 2019-12-23
### Added
Added ability to tag features with a section. Features may then be filtered by section from  `FeatureFlagsViewController` settings action sheet.

## [2.4.0] - 2019-12-22
### Added
Added option to filter by feature flag type from  `FeatureFlagsViewController` action sheet.

## [2.3.0] - 2019-12-17
### Added
New icons for feature flags and experiments (A/B tests and MVT tests).
### Changed
Fixed constraints in `FeatureFlagsTableViewCell` to close additional space where description label is hidden.

## [2.2.0] - 2019-12-16
### Added
Feature flags may now have a `description` field in JSON which will display in FeatureFlagsViewController providing more context around what the feature flag is used for.

## [2.1.2] - 2019-12-02
### Changed
- Stopped `FeatureFlagsViewController` reloading data by default on open as this prevents the user from inspecting the current state of feature flag by resetting their values. Instead feature flags will only be refreshed if `shouldRefresh` explicitly set `true` or refreshed by user via the UI. Additionally, feature flags will be refreshed in the event that `FeatureFlags.configuration` is nil.

## [2.1.1] - 2019-10-02
### Changed
- Fixed an issue with encoding a feature using `Codable` whereby the `labels` property would not be encoded.

## [2.1.0] - 2019-10-01
### Added
- Additional macros `TEST_VARIATION` and `USER_IS_IN_TEST_VARIATION` for interoperability with Objective-C.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-03-29
### Changed
- Updated from Swift 4.2 to Swift 5.

## [1.7.5] - 2019-03-07
### Added
- It is now possible to instantiate and add a feature flag programmatically.

## [1.7.4] - 2019-03-01
### Added
- Added method `isNoLongerUnderDevelopment()` which can be used to flush development status of a feature flag when development work on a feature is complete.

## [1.7.3] - 2019-01-28
### Changed
- Made `isDevelopment` flag less aggressive so it is possible to return development feature flags to regular feature flags once development complete. If `is-development` is set in either remote or local configuration then the flag will remain a development flag.

## [1.7.2] - 2019-01-18
### Changed
- Fixed an issue whereby feature flags were incorrectly being treated as unlock flags after being retrieved from persistence.

## [1.7.1] - 2019-01-18
### Changed
- Fixed a crash in the example app when pressing the action button.

## [1.7.0] - 2019-01-09
### Added
- Added unlock flags which can be used for unlocking (or locking) a feature permanently e.g. after the user has made an in-app purchase or a feature needs to be permanently unlocked programmatically following a certain date. To unlock or lock, optionally specify a default value for `unlocked` in the JSON config and then call `unlock()` or `lock()` as required. Use `isUnlocked()` to check current state.

## [1.6.1] - 2019-01-09
### Changed
- Relaxing SwiftLint requirement from an error to a warning as this prevents consumers from building where SwiftLint is not installed.

## [1.6.0] - 2019-01-04
### Added
- Added an option to the `FeatureFlagsViewController` action sheet to refresh features.

## [1.5.3] - 2019-01-03
### Changed
- Fixed an edge case issue whereby if a feature flag was not defined in remote configuration but defined locally and then retrieved from disk it would returned as a `Feature On/Off A/B Test` rather than as a standard `Feature Flag`.

## [1.5.2] - 2019-01-03
### Changed
- Lowered deployment target to iOS 9.0.

## [1.5.1] - 2019-01-02
### Changed
- Enabled `Allow app extension API only` in target deployment info. Presenting `UIViewController` must now be passed by caller when presenting `FeatureFlagsViewController`.
- Introduced a `Test.Variation` of `unassigned` for use in the event that a logic error occurs and a test variation cannot be assigned to a feature.

## [1.5.0] - 2018-12-21
### Changed
- Now possible to present FeatureFlagsViewController without a close button.
- Fixed an issue where test variation assignments were not stored in the sitatuation where no remote data or cached data present (first launch scenario).

## [1.4.0] - 2018-12-17
### Changed
- Swipe to delete on FeatureFlagsViewController now deletes the feature rather than clearing cache now that cache can be cleared via the action button. Note: If the feature is still present in the JSON then it will re-created on refresh.
- Updated refresh completion closures so that they are only invoked after the new configuration information is available.

## [1.3.1] - 2018-12-06
### Changed
- Switched method of random number generation from `drand48() * 100` to `Double.random(in: 0..<100.0)`.

## [1.3.0] - 2018-12-06
### Added
- Added `FeatureFlagsUI.autoRefresh` property to automatically refresh data from configuration when the app is foregrounded (defaults to `false`).
- Added ability to clear cache from `FeatureFlagsViewController`.
- Added convenience initializer to `Feature` allowing a Feature to be retrieved using `Feature(named: .myFeature)` rather than `Feature.named(.myFeature)`.

## [1.2.2] - 2018-12-05
### Added
- Added function `printFeatureFlags()` for printing flag status.
- Added function `printExtendedFeatureFlagInformation()` for printing more detailed flag information.
- Boundary tests to ensure user assigned to the correct A/B testing group.

## [1.2.1] - 2018-11-29
### Changed
- Fixed an issue where feature flag value could not be toggled through the UI.

## [1.2.0] - 2018-11-27
### Added
- Added support for Swift Package Manager.
### Changed

## [1.1.2] - 2018-11-26
### Changed

## [1.1.1] - 2018-11-19
### Changed
- Fixed an issue where if remote configuration could not be parsed, then fell back to cached configuration without making use of local fallback data in other loadConfiguration(:) method and refactored to eliminate code duplication.

### Changed
## [1.1.0] - 2018-11-17
### Added
- Support for development flags such that a feature flag can be marked such that the feature is never released unfinished even if remotely enabled later. To mark a feature as in development set the `development` property to `true` in the local fallback configuration.
### Changed
- Fixed an issue where if remote configuration could not be parsed, then fell back to cached configuration without making use of local fallback data.

```

## [0.1.2] - 2018-11-02
### Changed
- Fixed an issue whereby labels and test variations were returned even after a feature was disabled. Once a feature is globally disabled, a user should no longer belong to a test variation (for analytics purposes).

- Swipe to delete features from cache using FeatureFlagsViewController.

## [0.0.8] - 2018-11-01

- Made it possible to refresh configuration by passing data to be parsed directly into the refreshData(:completion:) method.

## [0.0.7] - 2018-10-31
